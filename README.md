# FICTION LUXURY

A  simple fictional car store site that was created and styled with HTML, CSS, bootstrap5 and javascript.


## SEMANTICS
    The html tags used in creating all sections of this web page were made to be semantically correct in order to ensure proper Search Engine Optimization.

### BUTTON
    When button is clicked:
        The style in the about section changes.
        It also displays and hides the navigation menu.
    Button when hovered over with mouse can alter the style(ie color) of the link and addresses in the store section.
    These were achieved using Javascript.

#### NAV-LINKS
    Hyper-links in the nav-bar redirects to a particular section of the page with a smooth scroll effect


##### RESPONSIVENESS
    When the web page is reduced to a smaller width, the navigation bar shifts to the right side of the screen. This was achieved using Bootstrap5
    The vehicles in the 4x4 grid also adjusts to columns when it is reduces to a smaller width.
    This ensures that the webpage can be used on every device irrespective of screen size. It was achieved using CSS(media-queries).
